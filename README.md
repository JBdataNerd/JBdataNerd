- 👋 Hi, I’m Jenn & as a 4x early-stage startup survivor, I found myself bootstrapped and figuring stuff out on my own, including teaching myself SQL and using tools such as Looker & Metabase. 📊
  - This experience has given me the opportunity to wear many (so many!) 🤠👒🎩, and a hat that I wear often is my data analyst 🎩 (the fanciest hat, as you can see!).

- ⚙️ I also learned Airtable and how to build automations with Zapier and Integromat (now Make).
  - While I’ve learned a lot, it was frustrating at times having to balance my actual job title work with all of this data muckery. 😵‍💫 _If you’ve ever tried to pull data for a visualization needed in reporting that is either non-existent or inconsistent, you understand the frustration._

- Over time, I found myself becoming more intrigued by data and the never ending quest for the “source of truth.” 🧐

- Eventually, I found myself in a role alongside experienced people who teach Data Engineering and thought, 🤷🏻‍♀️ _“Why not?!”_ 
  - Now, I’m delving deeper into understating data architecture, database design, analytical tools and frameworks, ETL processes, system maintenance and performance improvement, data privacy and compliance, cloud platforms, distributed systems, and how to support data scientists with machine learning models... (blah blah, so many!)

- If I love it, I will focus on data from now on! The journey is TBD... 🛣️
